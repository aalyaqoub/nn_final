          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Significant recent advancements in the field of GenAI have been
            achieved with Diffusion Models for image generation. Hence, many
            efforts have been deployed to ensure the generation of appropriate
            content by avoiding NSFW images and addressing copy-right issues. A
            number of solutions have been proposed to tackle this problem with
            different approaches centered around filtering, during either
            pre-training or post-generation.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this project we decide to look into a novel method focused on
            fine-tuning diffusion models using negative guidance as a teacher
            for the erasure of concepts, which has proven to be more effective
            than the aforementioned techniques. Most specifically, we are
            interested in answering the following questions:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Does this method produce different results on different model
              sizes? And what could be the ramifications of "forgetting" on
              smaller models?
            </li>
            <li>
              How does the erasure perform when the fine-tuning operation is
              conducted using unseen data? Is erasure reliant on generalization?
            </li>
            <li>
              By erasing a concept, is the model completely unlearning it or is
              it simply being suppressed from being expressed? In either case,
              how easy is it to relearn an erased concept? Does it require the
              same original training effort? Does it produce images of the same
              quality?
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Paper Overview</h2>
          <p>
            The paper at hand proposes a method to remove concepts permanently
            from a diffusion model which makes it very hard to circumvent even
            if the user has access to the model weights. Previous methods based
            on filtering datasets are fundamentally costly and not flexible to
            problems discovered after training while filtering generated content
            can have unintended consequences on the output quality.
          </p>
          <p>
            To address these issues, ESD relies on fine-tuning pre-trained
            diffusion models to minimize the probability of generating certain
            images linked to a targeted concept and using no additional data.
            The fine-tuning process involves using several instances of the
            model with one set of parameters frozen while training the other set
            of parameters to erase the concept. Partially de-noised images,
            constrained by the concept, are sampled from the training model
            while inference is performed twice on the frozen model to predict
            noise both conditioned and unconditioned on the prompt which
            combined to negate the predicted noise associated with the targeted
            concept. This technique modifies the scoring function to move the
            data distribution to minimize the generation images that can be
            labeled with the targeted prompt.

                style="width: 70px"
              />
              . <b>This leaves us with the predicted noise of just Van Gogh.</b>
            </li>
            <li>
              <img
                src="images/math/GeneralNoVan.png"
                alt="External Image"
                style="width: 290px"
              />
              represents the general noise

                alt="External Image"
                style="width: 70px"
              />
              minus the predicted noice of just Van Gogh.
              <b>
                This leaves us with the noise of everything but Van Gogh. This
                is our objective that the model is trying to reach.
              </b>
            </li>
            <li>
              Now we arrive at our loss objective. The goal is to minimise the
              predicted noise of Van Gogh and maximize the noise of everything
              but Van Gogh.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The degree of success attributed to the erasure of a concept depends
            on the subset of parameters fine-tuned with a main distinction
            between cross-attention and non-cross-attention parameters. In the
            paper, ESD-x refers to the process of fine-tuning the
            cross-attention parameters which is used to perform controlled
            erasure specific to the prompt. This method has demonstrated
            impressive results for specific artistic style removal. On the other
            hand, ESD-u refers to non-cross-attention fine-tuned parameters
            which tend to contribute to a broader range of visual concepts when
            the erasure is required to be independent of the text in the prompt
            which is crucial for the generation of nudity free content.
          </p>
          <p>
            The experimental study for this solution on its artistic style
            removal capabilities involved erasing 5 modern artists and
            conducting a user study to measure the human perception of the
            effectiveness of the fine-tuned model compared to other approaches.
            The study showed that ESD-x had superior results demonstrated by its
            ability to erase the intended style better but also to keep minimum
            interference with the other styles. The performance of ESD-u-n for
            removing explicit content was measure against SLD and SD V.20 and
            showed that the method proposed in this paper outperforms both
            inference methods and models trained on filtered datasets.

            Erasing an entire object class still involves some limitations
            represented by a trade-off between complete erasure of a visual
            concept and interference with other visual concepts.

          <h2>Methods</h2>
          <h3>Effect on Smaller Models</h3>
          <p>
            To test out the models effect on different model sizes, we used the
            following
            <a href="https://huggingface.co/OFA-Sys/small-stable-diffusion-v0"
              >small stable diffusion</a

            and
            <a href="https://huggingface.co/lambdalabs/miniSD-diffusers"
              >mini stable diffusion</a
            >
            models which are smaller implementations of Stable Diffusion. Our
            method consits of erasing the same concept from each model along
            side the
            <a

            >
            model originally employed by the paper and then analyze the impact
            of erasing object on the model through inference with multiple
            prompts with related to the concept being erased.

          </div>
          <h3>Relearning Concepts</h3>
          <p>
            We theorize that the model is not completely unlearning a particular
            concept, but rather suppressing it from being expressed by making
            the probability of generating images with the concept very low.
            Since the concept that was erased is still present in the model, it
            could be possible to relearn concepts by fine-tuning the model with
            the same objective as the erasure process, but with a constrait that
            prioritizes the generation of images with the concept we desire. A
            traditional way to relearn the concept would be to fine-tune the
            model with data of the concept you desire to relearn. The method we
            are testing has the benefit of not requiring training data of the
            concept that was erased as the model will depend on the suppressed
            knowledge of the concept already in its weights.
          </p>

            <li>
              To test this theory out, we will initialize our forzen model to be

            </li>
            <li>
              From this forzen model we will grab the predicted noise of the

              />.
            </li>
            <li>
              The predicted noise of the concept will be combined with the
              general noise

              />. This is will represent the goal the model is trying to reach.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Results</h2>
          <h3>Effect on Smaller Models</h3>
          <p>
            Erasing concepts via ESD-u can have a severe affect on smaller
            models' ability to generate images. We tested the erasure of the
            object "car" on the normal, small, amd mini models and found that
            the smaller models struggled with removing the object. For both the
            small and the mini model, removing the object by fine-tuning the
            non-cross attention parameters caused the model to lose its ability
            to generate proper images and content. Post fine-tuning, the models'
            ability to generate any image, including those of other objects, was
            severely hampered indicating that the model was dead. We also tried
            removing global concepts, like nudity, using the ESD-u method and
            found that the models produced similar nonsensical images. That
            being said, the smaller models were able to remove styles from the
            model using ESD-x. We belive that the smaller models are not able to
            handle erasure through ESD-u

          <h3>Relearning</h3>
          <p>
            When we attempted to relearn the concept of Van Gogh and the object
            car we found that the models were not able to resurface the
            information that was removed. We believe this is the case because
            after the original epochs to erase the concept from the model the
            predicted noise of the concept is so low that relearning the concept
            from it does not effect the overall model much.
